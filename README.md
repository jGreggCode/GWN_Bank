# GWN Bank (Ongoing)
Intermediate Programming Final Project

# Referenced Libraries Needed
- Timing Framework v0.55
- Mysql Connector v8.x (If using the database branch)

## Key feaures
- Login System
- Cash withdrawal/deposit/bank transfer
- View recent and old transactions

## How to Open/Run
- Create a java project first (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/java/java-tutorial#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20create%20a,build%20tool%20from%20this%20command)
- Add the needed libraries
- Run the Main class from Main/Main.java

## Note
- Frame size is fixed to 1440x1000 for better quality,
- Screen resolution must be at least 1080p to view the full size of the program.
- Used null layout so even if the frame is set to resizable some components would not show if downscaled.
